# 📘C Programming Tutorial 

Welcome to the **C Programming Tutorial** repository! This project is designed to help **absolute beginners** learn the **C programming language** from the ground up. Whether you're a student, an aspiring developer, or someone diving into programming for the first time, this guide will help you master the core concepts of C.

## 🧠 What is C?

**C** is a powerful, low-level, general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is often considered the foundation of modern programming because:

- Many other languages (C++, Java, Python, etc.) are influenced by it.
- It's widely used in system/software development, embedded systems, operating systems (like Linux), and more.
- It teaches you how computers work at the hardware level.
